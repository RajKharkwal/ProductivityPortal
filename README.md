# Productivity Portal
Welcome to the Productivity Portal! This web application aims to boost your productivity by providing essential tools like a Pomodoro timer, a to-do list, and Spotify integration for your focus sessions.

## Features

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Our Pomodoro timer helps you implement this technique effectively by providing:

### Start, pause, and reset functionalities.
Customizable session lengths: Pomodoro (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), and Long Break (15 minutes).
Visual cues to indicate different session types.

### To-Do List
Stay organized and manage your tasks efficiently with our built-in to-do list feature. You can:

### Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed to track your progress.
Prioritize tasks with drag-and-drop functionality.
### Spotify Integration
Enhance your focus sessions with your favorite music playlists from Spotify. Simply paste your Spotify playlist link, and enjoy seamless integration while you work.
